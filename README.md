# Heartbeat-Prognostics

Our project aims to leverage a subset of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset to predict heart disease among individuals. First we will establish a baseline model based on the BRFSS 2013 dataset, which is originally comprised of responses from 491,773 individuals, encompassing 336 features. However, our focus will be on a cleaned subset consisting of 384,695 survey responses from BRFSS 2013, containing 20 pertinent features.

Additional datasets from 2011 and 2015 using the same subset of features will be used as a comparison against this 2013-based model to determine whether this model can be extended for predictions within a margin of time in the near past and future.

The ultimate objective of this project is to develop a robust classification model capable of accurately predicting the likelihood of heart disease among individuals. By utilizing machine learning techniques, we aim to create a model that can assist in early detection and intervention, thereby potentially saving lives.

This project holds significant importance due to the pervasive impact of heart disease, which remains the leading cause of death globally. By developing an accurate prediction model, we can empower individuals to take proactive steps towards their cardiovascular health. Early identification of risk factors can prompt individuals to undergo regular screenings, adopt healthier lifestyles, and seek timely medical intervention, potentially reducing healthcare costs associated with reactive treatments.
